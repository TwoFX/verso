# A Laser-Focused First Year

At the Lean FRO, we recognize that there are several obstacles to the wider adoption of Lean that, while significant, are small enough to be removed by our team. Addressing these challenges is our foremost priority in the first year of the Lean Focused Research Organization (FRO).



* **Taking care of "paper cuts":** We will be vigilant in identifying small yet painful issues that occur when using Lean, such as insufficient or misleading error messages, unexpected performance issues, or needlessly brittle tooling.
* **Eliminating Obstacles and Enhancing User Experience**: We will refine the user interface, streamline processes, and eliminate bugs or inconveniences that hinder the user experience.
* **Improving Documentation**: We are investing in improving and expanding Lean's documentation. This includes creating comprehensive, easy-to-understand guides and resources that cater to users at all levels – from beginners to advanced practitioners.
* **Developing Cloud Build Support**: A major technical endeavor for us will be the development of robust cloud build support for Lean packages. That is, allowing users to quickly download prebuilt artifacts rather than perform a slow build from the source. This initiative will facilitate more efficient and scalable usage of Lean, particularly in handling large and complex projects,
* **Reservoir, the Lean Package Registry**: We will launch Reservoir, the Lean package repository. It will serve not just as a registry for packages, but also as a platform to report package incompatibilities and breakages. Reservoir will be instrumental in providing cloud build support for all registered packages, fostering a rich package ecosystem.
* **Standard Library**: We envision a standard library akin to Rust’s, but with specifications, proofs and tactics for its main components. The Lean standard library will also serve as the bedrock for many other packages and projects.
* **Enhancing Proof Automation**: Advancing Lean’s proof automation capabilities is another key focus. We aim to make the process of developing and verifying proofs more efficient and user-friendly.
* **Tooling for Decentralized Work and a Rich Package Ecosystem**: We plan to provide tools that enable users to work in a decentralized manner.

Efforts are underway to hire a professional designer to harmonize the aesthetics and user experience across the FRO website, the Lean site, documentation pages, Loogle, Reservoir, and other related platforms. This unified design approach is aimed at creating a consistent and appealing visual identity for Lean.

**Community Involvement and Feedback**: Input from the Lean community will be vital in shaping the website. User feedback will inform the design and content, ensuring that the website meets the needs and preferences of a diverse user base.

**Project Execution and Contributor Suitability**: While a professional designer will lead the visual aspects of the website, there are numerous opportunities for contributors with skills in web development, content creation, and user experience design. Contributors can assist in various aspects such as developing website features, writing content, or providing feedback on design and usability.


## 21. New Code Generator (Starting on Year 2)

**Description**: The development of a new and improved code generator is a significant initiative for Lean. This component is crucial since Lean users often implement theory-specific automation and extensions using Lean itself. Mathlib, as an example, is not just a repository of mathematical theories but also includes proof automation code and extensions written in Lean.

**Goals and Impact**: While Lean 4 already generates efficient code, there is considerable scope for enhancement. The aim is to optimize the code generator to further improve the performance and efficiency of Lean. This is not just about enhancing Lean’s own performance; it extends to optimizing the performance of every user-written extension and proof automation procedure. Thus, improvements in the code generator will directly contribute to the scalability and efficiency of the entire Lean ecosystem.

**Dependence on Other Features**: Several other planned features, such as a Debugger, are dependent on improvements to the code generator. As such, progress in this area will have a cascading positive effect on other components and functionalities within Lean.

**Suitability for Contributors**: This component is suited for contributors with a strong background in compiler design, code optimization, and a deep understanding of Lean's architecture. The task is technically demanding and requires contributors who can navigate the complexities of code generation and optimization. It is not suited to new contributors.


## 22. Debugger (Starting on Year 2 or 3)

**Description**: The introduction of a Debugger for Lean programs addresses a commonly requested feature from the Lean user community. As users increasingly write programs, Lean extensions, and proof automation procedures directly in Lean, the need for a robust debugging tool has become more pronounced. This tool will significantly enhance the development experience within Lean, particularly for complex coding and automation tasks.

**Dependency on Code Generator Improvements**: The development and effectiveness of the Debugger are closely linked to the progress made in the New Code Generator task. Enhancements in code generation, as previously described, will directly impact the capabilities and performance of the Debugger, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

**Benefits for Programming and Usability**: While the Debugger will primarily assist users in identifying and resolving issues in Lean programs and extensions, it also extends benefits to those using Lean as a programming language. By providing insights into the execution of Lean code and facilitating the identification of bugs and inefficiencies, the Debugger will improve the overall usability and efficiency of Lean as a programming and automation tool.

**Suitability for Contributors**: This project is suitable for contributors with experience in developing debugging tools, a strong understanding of software development processes, and familiarity with Lean’s architecture. Given the technical complexity of this task, it is not a good match for new contributors.


## 23. Metaprogramming Guide (Starting on Year 2)

**Description**: The Metaprogramming Guide for Lean is an essential resource for the community, especially for those interested in extending Lean’s capabilities and adding new functionalities. While the community has been actively developing and maintaining this manual, there is a need to further refine and enhance it.

**Enhancement and Completion**: Following the release of a polished Reference Manual, David Thrane Christiansen will undertake the task of ensuring that the Metaprogramming Manual is comprehensive, approachable, and user-friendly. The aim is to make the manual a definitive guide for metaprogramming in Lean, covering all aspects from basic to advanced techniques.

**Empowering Contributors**: A key goal of the Metaprogramming Manual is to empower new contributors. By providing clear, detailed, and accessible information, the manual will enable newcomers to effectively extend Lean and contribute to its ecosystem. This approach aligns with the vision of decentralization, where a broader base of contributors can add value and functionality to Lean.

**Suitability for Contributors**: While David Thrane Christiansen will lead this project, there are opportunities for contributors with experience in Lean metaprogramming to assist in writing, reviewing, and providing feedback on the manual. This task is well-suited for those who are passionate about education, documentation, and the dissemination of knowledge within the Lean community.
