This is an example document. There's still bogus syntax highlighting
and no LSP features, but it does seem to run things.

# Next steps

There are a number of basic things to fix:

 * Emphasis isn't how it should be - there's only one kind (*no bold!*)
 * No inline code or math or numbered lists yet
 * The parser is a bit of a kludge, with too much lookahead making up
   for lack of a clear structure
 * Custom directives are block-only for now, and are not yet
   extensible with custom elaborators
 * Gratuitous line breaks a la GitHub-flavored Markdown

For demo-worthiness, we also need:

 * Fancier LSP support - at least highlight list elements and show the breadcrumbs
   * Some works now, but it's hacky
   * Only Emacs seems to show the bullet point highlights, so I need VS Code help
   * Still, it's fun!
 * At least one or two "global" document operations, like resolving cross-references
 * Embedded Lean examples with elaboration

It's still a start, though!
